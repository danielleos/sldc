    <p class="text _text">Following his long standing interest in this speciality, David gained his MSC in endoendentology in 2012. He shares his time between us and an endodontic referral practice in Manchester. We use modern techniques and equipment such as a dental operating microscope, which enables us to save many teeth that would otherwise have been lost. Important as technology is, looking after the patient as a person remains our primary aim. David also treats patients on a referral from colleagues within the practice and the local area.</p>

    <p class="intro">Sedation<br></p>
    <p class="text _text">Most patients experience some level of anxiety when visiting the dentist. This is usually eased with a friendly, gently manner and will hopefully lead to a relaxed, trusting relationship with your dentist. All our dental team are experienced in dealing with anxious patients and we are happy to take things as slowly as necessary. However, we realise that some patients may need a little extra help. For those patients, we can offer intravenous conscious sedation. If you are nervous about having dental treatment or you are having a procedure which may cause discomfort, intravenous (IV) sedation is an effective and safe treatment.<br></p>
